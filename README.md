<h1 align="center">SmartCart</h1>

Users can create a grocery list at home which they can utilize at the grocery store. Users scan items as they pick them up, the items are crossed off the list, and the accumulated total is shown.

## Inspiration
Going from living with your family to living by yourself in university can be a huge change. WIth freedom comes responsibility and many may find the challenges of taking on financial responsibility for things such as rent and meals overwhelming. To make grocery shopping less heavy on the wallet for those with strict meal budgets such as university students, we created SmartCart :).

## What it does
Leading up to a trip to the grocery store, users can add items to your grocery list on the app. At the grocery store, they can scan items as they place it in their cart or basket to cross it off their shopping list. If they select the store they are shopping at, the app will accumulate the total cost of their groceries based on their current prices with tax at that store. The user may choose to include their total spending budget with the app to easily see if they are exceeding their budget or have money remaining to spend.

## How it was built
React-native and expo were used to build the app.

## What's next for Augmented Workouts
In the future, I hope to create different diet profiles that users can select to fit their eating habits. Examples of these could be vegan, bulking diet, or carb-conious. This way, we can better reccomend to users if they should buy certain items.
